Regrow is a general resourse locator that helps people in finding neccessary resourses around them in case of any disaster.
Regrow provides a simple, elegant and easy-to-use user interface. We have made this mobile application using Firebase cloud database thus providing fast resource sharing. 
With just one click you can mark out the resources and share it with others.

We provide various functionalities listed below:
<ul>
<li>The ability to add different markers on the map based on the resource or danger found at the Location</li>
<li>Ability to send the location of those resources or dangers to all the people to help them protect humanity 
</li>
<li>Ability to download the markers, so people always are able to find a way to the resourses and protect themselves from the danger.
</li>
</ul>
